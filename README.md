# Cybersecurity Design for the British University in Egypt (BUE)
📌 Abstract

The British University in Egypt (BUE) acknowledges the importance of protecting its IT infrastructure from evolving cybersecurity threats. This project presents a comprehensive cybersecurity design based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF V2.0), ensuring a risk-based approach to securing the university's digital resources.

The primary objectives of this cybersecurity design are to:

    Safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) of IT assets.
    Prevent unauthorized access while ensuring secure resource sharing.
    Mitigate threats such as phishing, DDoS attacks, insider threats, and ransomware.
    Promote a security-conscious culture among staff and students.

🏛 Cybersecurity Framework & Approach
1️⃣ NIST CSF-Based Security Strategy

The design aligns with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF V2.0), structured around six core functions:

    Govern – Establish security policies and compliance measures.
    Identify – Assess assets, vulnerabilities, and potential threats.
    Protect – Implement security controls to safeguard resources.
    Detect – Monitor systems for threats and anomalies.
    Respond – Develop incident response strategies.
    Recover – Ensure business continuity and recovery planning.

2️⃣ Key Security Controls & Measures

To strengthen the university’s cybersecurity posture, the following security controls are implemented:

✅ Identity & Access Management (IAM) – Role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
✅ Network Segmentation & Firewalls – Isolating critical systems to reduce attack surfaces.
✅ Data Encryption – Encrypting sensitive student, faculty, and research data.
✅ Endpoint Protection – Antivirus, anti-malware, and endpoint detection and response (EDR).
✅ Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) – Centralized monitoring for real-time threat detection.
✅ User Awareness Training – Phishing simulations and cybersecurity best practices.
🛡 Threat Mitigation Strategies
Threat Type	Mitigation Measures
Phishing Attacks	Email filtering, security awareness training, anti-phishing tools
DDoS Attacks	Intrusion prevention systems (IPS), rate limiting, cloud-based DDoS protection
Insider Threats	Strict access controls, activity monitoring, behavior analysis
Ransomware	Regular backups, endpoint security, incident response plans
🚀 Implementation Roadmap

To ensure a smooth and phased implementation, the cybersecurity strategy follows a structured roadmap:
🔹 Phase 1: Risk assessment, policy development, security governance setup
🔹 Phase 2: Deployment of IAM, network segmentation, firewall configurations
🔹 Phase 3: Data encryption, endpoint security, and SIEM integration
🔹 Phase 4: User training, continuous monitoring, and response planning
🔹 Phase 5: Incident response testing, audits, and security optimizations
🎯 Expected Outcomes

By adopting this cybersecurity framework, BUE aims to:

    Enhance data security and compliance with global standards.
    Prevent cyber threats through proactive risk management.
    Improve security awareness among students, faculty, and staff.
    Ensure business continuity with an effective incident response plan.

🛠 Future Enhancements

    AI-driven threat intelligence for real-time anomaly detection.
    Blockchain-based identity management for enhanced security.
    Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) implementation for access security.
