# Cybersecurity Design for the British University in Egypt (BUE)
📌 Abstract

The British University in Egypt (BUE) recognizes the importance of protecting its IT infrastructure from evolving cyber threats. This project presents a comprehensive cybersecurity design, leveraging the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF V2.0) to implement a risk-based approach and security controls tailored to the university's needs.

The key objectives of this cybersecurity design are to:

    Ensure the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA triad) of IT assets.
    Prevent unauthorized access while enabling secure resource sharing.
    Mitigate potential threats, such as phishing, DDoS, insider threats, and ransomware.
    Foster a security-conscious culture among students, faculty, and staff.

🏛 Cybersecurity Framework & Approach
🔹 NIST CSF-Based Security Strategy

The design follows the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF V2.0), which consists of six core functions:

    Govern – Establish security policies and compliance measures.
    Identify – Assess IT assets, vulnerabilities, and potential threats.
    Protect – Implement security measures to safeguard systems.
    Detect – Continuously monitor for cyber threats and anomalies.
    Respond – Define strategies for incident response and threat mitigation.
    Recover – Implement disaster recovery and business continuity planning.

🛡 Key Security Controls & Measures
✅ Identity & Access Management (IAM)

    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced login security.

✅ Network Security

    Firewalls & Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor network traffic.
    Network Segmentation to isolate critical systems and reduce attack surfaces.

✅ Data Protection

    Encryption (AES-256) for securing sensitive student, faculty, and research data.
    Regular Data Backups to prevent data loss and ensure recoverability.

✅ Endpoint & Application Security

    Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) to monitor and protect user devices.
    Secure Software Development Practices to prevent vulnerabilities in applications.

✅ Security Monitoring & Incident Response

    Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) for real-time threat detection.
    Incident Response Plans (IRP) to quickly mitigate security breaches.

✅ Cybersecurity Awareness & Training

    Phishing Attack Simulations to educate users on email-based threats.
    Mandatory Security Training for students, faculty, and staff.

⚠️ Threat Mitigation Strategies

| **Threat Type**        | **Mitigation Measures** |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Phishing Attacks**   | Email filtering, anti-phishing tools, security training |
| **DDoS Attacks**       | Intrusion prevention, cloud-based DDoS protection |
| **Insider Threats**    | Strict access controls, activity monitoring |
| **Ransomware**         | Endpoint security, regular backups, incident response |



🚀 Implementation Roadmap

The cybersecurity strategy follows a structured, phased implementation to minimize disruptions:


    🔹 Phase 1: Risk assessment, security policy development, compliance review

    🔹 Phase 2: IAM setup, firewall deployment, network segmentation

    🔹 Phase 3: Data encryption, endpoint security, SIEM implementation

    🔹 Phase 4: User training, continuous monitoring, incident response planning

    🔹 Phase 5: Security audits, testing, ongoing optimization

🎯 Expected Outcomes:

    By adopting this cybersecurity design, BUE aims to:
    ✅ Strengthen IT security and protect critical assets.
    ✅ Reduce cyber threats through proactive risk management.
    ✅ Enhance security awareness across all user groups.
    ✅ Ensure business continuity with a strong incident response plan.
    
🔮 Future Enhancements

    AI-driven threat intelligence for automated security monitoring.
    Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) for stricter access control.
    Blockchain-based identity management for secure authentication.
